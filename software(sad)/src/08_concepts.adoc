= Overview

This document aims to explain and set the conventions for technical architecture, design, and behavior
across the entire system. The main purpose of this document is to ensure conceptual integrity.

== Domain Models

Definition of terms used in the software to describe abstract entities.

[cols="1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| Term | Definition | Notes

| Player
| The player references to the individuals who will be on the arcade interface controling, scanning and playing th game
| The player class specifically represents the fish

| Obstacle
| Describes the plastic debree (micro-plastic) that appears in the game which the fish has to dodge in order to progress
| Types: Splitter Obstacle, Sin Obstacle, At Player Obstacle, Bounce Obstacle

| Scanner (Barcode Scanner)
| Referes to an actual physical barcode-scanner, which is attached to the arcade. it is used to scan barcodes tagged on various clothing determining the difficulty of the game
| Along the scanner will be three barcodes to scane for three different difficulty options

== User Experience Concepts

TBD

== Safety and Security Concepts

It should not be possible to cheat in our game, hence we will have to ensure data integrity and security.
Since the game is isolated and running locally in an arcade machine, there wont be specific technical
implementation dedicated to security, instead, debugging should be main priority (example; check that
the player cannot swim outside of boundaries).

== Architecture and Design Patterns

- link:./09_architecture_decisions.adoc[Architecture Decisions]

== “Under-the-hood” Concepts

The game uses a fixed timestep loop of 60 fps.

== Development Concepts

*Language & Imports*:

- Java 21
- pi4j
- googlecode.json-simple
- openjfx
- slf4j
- fazecast
- junit.jupiter
- javadoc

*Development Tools*:

- IntelliJ / Visual Studio Code
- Git, GitLab, GitKraken, GitDesktop
- Maven

== Operational Concepts

*Startup & Shutdown Behavior*:The game (should) start automatically when the arcade machine is turned on. A door on the back of the
machine can be opened to take out / provide maintanance to the electronics if needed.

*Logging*: The "Logger.java" stores certain events happening in the code in a log file.

*Usage Data*: Highscores are stored within a (theoratical) json file.
