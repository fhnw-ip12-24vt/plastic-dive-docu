== D01 DTO for Obstacle-Classes

*Problem*:  
We have identified that the "Movable" class and all its children have very long and repetitive parameter
lists in their constructors. This leads to bloated instantiations and can negatively impact performance,
readability, and future maintainability, as every instantiation must manually pass numerous parameters.

*Solution*:  
A DTO (Data Transfer Object) is a design pattern where all the attributes of a class are encapsulated
in a separate, dedicated data class. This DTO contains private fields along with getters and setters,
allowing controlled access to its data. This not only improves encapsulation and debugging but also
simplifies parameter management. In our case, the constructor of the "Movable" class can be reduced
to accept a single DTO object, promoting cleaner code and better separation of concerns. Additional
benefits include the ability to:
- Set default values,
- Implement logic inside setters (e.g., auto-update related fields),
- Reuse the DTO for multiple instances.

*Alternatives*:  
We considered using a Java "record" class, which offers a similar concise structure. However, records
make all fields immutable (final), which is unsuitable for dynamic values like x and y coordinates in
our game. Thus, the DTO approach provides the necessary flexibility.

*CANCELLED*: some people in the team regarded the DTO as "overkill" and not needed after it was already
completed @michael galambos

== D02 Obstacle Spawner Factory

*Problem*:
In our initial implementation, obstacle classes were instantiated directly using their constructors.
This tightly coupled the creation logic to specific classes, which made it difficult to switch between
different obstacle types, dynamically adjust spawning behavior, or scale the system with new obstacle
variations. This approach also violated the Open-Closed Principle, since adding new obstacle types
often required modifying existing spawning code.

*Solution*:
We implemented the Factory Design Pattern to encapsulate the creation logic of obstacle classes in a
centralized "ObstacleFactory". This factory takes input parameters such as type identifiers or DTOs
and returns the appropriate obstacle instance. This improves flexibility by allowing different obstacle
types to be instantiated dynamically at runtime, based on game state or configuration. It also enhances
maintainability, as new obstacle types can be added without modifying core spawning logic — only the
factory needs to be extended. In addition, this design simplifies testing, as factories can be mocked
or stubbed to control object creation in unit tests.

*Alternatives*:
Manually instantiating the obstacles directly would have been a possible choice since it makes
code implementation simpler but comes with the downsides explained in the problem section.

== D03 MVC

*Problem*:
We need a way to separate gui, logic and data from each other, otherwise debugging the code and getting
an overview will be significantly more difficult. The MVC design pattern offers a solution for exactly
that issue.

*Solution*:
We decided to implement the MVC pattern since the beginning of the project and it is continuously being
upheld. The MVC follows clean code standards such as the separation of concern principle since it neatly
divides logic, data and graphic from each other making debugging easier.

*Alternatives*: 
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is a software architectural pattern that separates the user interface (UI)
from the underlying business logic and data. The Model represents the actual data, domain logic, and
business rules of the application. The View is what the user sees and interacts with — typically, this
is your UI (buttons, text fields, etc.). The ViewModel acts as a middle layer between the View and the
Model. Its job is to prepare and manage the data for the View. Because the MVVM design pattern however
is rather foreign to us, we decided against it and used the much more well established MVC.

== D04 Singleton for Logger

*Problem*: The software uses simple print statements (or none at all!) to track what is happening where
and when. This may be useful for developers when debugging, looking into the console, however it makes
the code look cluttered and much more difficult to maintain since any class can call the print statement
and it would be hard to track from which class it came.

*Solution*: Instead of using print statements, an object can rely on a singleton instance of a logger
class, which can be accessed globally throughout the code. This allows developers to track exactly which
object invoked the logger and store that information in a log file for later analysis, while also
making it easier to enforce global logging rules through the singleton.

*Alternatives*: An alternative to using a singleton logger would be dependency injection, where each
object or module receives a logger instance explicitly (often passed as a constructor or method argument).
This approach improves testability, makes dependencies clearer, and avoids the global state issues
associated with singletons. However this introduces potential risks of violating

and make parameters in many methods too long. Additionally it would be harder to enforce a global rule
on all objects who use the logger and make a log file, since there can be multiple different logger
instances used in the code.
