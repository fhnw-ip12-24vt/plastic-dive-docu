## How we hand everything over
### Hardware
Everything that is hardware is taken by Primeo personally. We only have to bring it to the [Abschluss-Event IP12](https://fhnw-projecttrack.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ip1224vt/pages/344392383/IP12-24vt+Abschluss-Event+in+Bearbeitung) on the 11/06.
### Software
Everything that software is automatically given to Primeo via git exports. This also means that as long as everything is in the repositories we dont have to do anything more.
